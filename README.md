MC3-Executah is a workaround which enables the graphical launching of foreign executables. By default, on MC3 computers, this behavior is blocked in Windows Explorer. In other words... you can use MC3-Executah to launch programs that you have downloaded from the internet or stored on a flash drive.

MC3-Executah is compatible with any Windows system that has Java 7 or later installed. If you need to install java, please use OpenJDK to support open source software. You can get it from www.adoptopenjdk.net.

Q: Does MC3-Executah allow for the launching of executables that require administrative privileges to launch?
A: No, and it also won't bypass UAC promts in applications that require privilege escalation at any point post-launch.

Q: Can't I just use a command-line shell to bypass this restriction?
A: Yes, but the advantags MC3-Executah offers are ease of use, a nicer user interface, and faster speed, considering MCCC's bad command-line shell defaults.

Q: Can't I just use the "run" program to bypass this restriction?
A: Yes, however, the "run" program requires you to either browse for the file manually, or type in a file path. MC3-Executah on the other hand, is drag-and-drop.

Q: Will MC3-Executah work at non-MC3 colleges, libraries, workplaces, etc?
A: Potentially, but it depends on the group policy of the institution in question. Sometimes it won't be of much use, for example if launching java executables is restricted. That said, it could prove very handy in an enviornment where the "run", "cmd", and "powershell" programs are hidden entirely, but java is installed, such as in many libraries.

Happy bypassing!
